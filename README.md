# al-goma — Albin's Grocery Machine

A terminal-based meal planner and grocery list generator. Tell it what dishes you know how to cook, and it'll randomly pick a weekly menu and build a shopping list for you — sorted by category so you can actually navigate a grocery store like a human.

Built in Rust with [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui).

## What it does

- Keeps a "Dishtabase" of your dishes and their ingredients
- Randomly generates a menu from your dishes (you pick how many)
- Builds a shopping list from the menu, deduplicating ingredients automatically
- Categorizes ingredients (vegetables, fruit, dairy, protein, pantry, spices) so your list is sorted by grocery store section
- Auto-detects ingredient categories from a built-in lookup database
- Prompts you to pick a category manually when one can't be determined
- Lets you manually add or remove items from the shopping list
- Exports the shopping list to a `.txt` file with optional numbering and category grouping
- Supports English and Swedish (set in `.config/settings.toml`)

## Language

The UI language is set in `.config/settings.toml`:

```toml
language = "Eng"   # or "Swe"
```

The file is created automatically on first run (defaults to English).

---

## Data

All data is stored in `.config/` inside the project directory:

- `.config/dishes.toml` — your Dishtabase
- `.config/sh_list.toml` — your current shopping list
- `.config/settings.toml` — language setting

These are plain TOML files and can be edited by hand. Exported shopping lists are saved as `Shopping-Lists/Shopping_List-YYYY-MM-DD.txt` (subsequent exports the same day get a numbered suffix).
